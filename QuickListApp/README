An Android listview with rounded borders
========================================

A quick hack at creating a list view with rounded borders.  This seems to work but I am sure there are better ways to do this - at least I hope there are

The QuickListAppActiviy should show a list with rounded borders which highlights in green. 

Some things to note:

1. The list activity has a customer adapter which lets me add items with different layouts  see onCreate in the QuickListActivity
2. The top item gets a res/layout/toplist_layout
3. The bottom item gets a res/layout/bottomlist_layout
4. The middle items get gets a res/mid/bottomlist_layout
5. Each layout points to a selector for the background e.g (/res/drawble/top_list_selector)
6. For the top on bottom selectors you point different shapes to show the top and bottom borders.
7. The mid_list_selector does not need a shape as it is square so the selector just users colors.
8. Also remember to add  android:listSelector="@android:color/transparent" to your list view - see the main.xml.  This stops a highlight appearing behind the rouded borders

Hope this is informative - please fork and improve
